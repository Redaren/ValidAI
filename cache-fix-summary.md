# Prompt Caching Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The caching was failing due to **multiple cache control markers** being added to different parts of the message, which breaks Anthropic's caching mechanism.

### Root Causes
1. **Two Cache Markers**: Both system message AND file had cache control markers
2. **Wrong Strategy**: System messages are too short to cache individually (29 tokens < 1024 minimum)
3. **Cache Prefix Mismatch**: Multiple markers caused cache entries that couldn't be matched

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Single Cache Point Strategy
- **Removed** cache control from system messages completely
- **Keep** cache control ONLY on file content (PDF/text)
- System message still goes in messages array (required for caching) but without cache marker

### 2. Smart Cache Detection
- Only add cache control when creating NEW cache (not when using existing)
- Check token minimums: 1024 for most models, 2048 for Haiku
- Warn if content is too small to cache

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Clear indication of cache strategy (CREATE/USE/NONE)
- Warning for multiple cache markers
- Detailed cache results with cost savings
- Error messages explaining why cache might fail

## How It Works Now

### Creating Cache (First Message)
```
1. System message â†’ messages array (NO cache control)
2. File content â†’ messages array (WITH cache control at the end)
3. User prompt â†’ messages array (NO cache control)
```
Result: Single cache marker at the optimal position

### Using Cache (Subsequent Messages)
```
1. System message â†’ messages array (NO cache control)
2. File content â†’ messages array (NO cache control - preserving structure)
3. User prompt â†’ messages array (NO cache control)
```
Result: Exact prefix match for cache hit

## Expected Behavior

### First Request (Create Cache)
- Log: "âœ… Single cache marker detected"
- Log: "âœ… CACHE CREATED: X tokens cached"
- Response: `cachedWriteTokens > 0`

### Second Request (Use Cache)
- Log: "Cache strategy: USE EXISTING CACHE"
- Log: "âœ… CACHE HIT: X/Y tokens"
- Log: "ðŸ’° COST SAVINGS: ~Z tokens"
- Response: `cachedReadTokens > 0`

## Testing Instructions

1. **Upload a PDF** or text file with substantial content (>1KB for text, >10KB for PDF)
2. **Add a system prompt** (can be short now)
3. **Enable "Create cache"** toggle
4. **Send first message** - should see cache created
5. **Disable "Create cache"** toggle
6. **Send second message** - should see cache hit with 90% savings

## Key Insight
Anthropic's caching works on **exact prefix matching**. Having multiple cache markers creates multiple cache entries that can't be properly matched. The solution is to have a **single cache marker at the end of all static content** that you want to cache together.
