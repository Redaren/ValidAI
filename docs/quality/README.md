# Quality Documentation Hub

Welcome to the ValidAI Quality Documentation Hub. This directory contains comprehensive guides for maintaining high code quality, testing standards, and development processes.

## Quick Navigation

### ðŸš€ Quick Start
- [**Quick Start Guide**](quick-start.md) - Get up and running with quality tools in 5 minutes
- [**Testing Guide**](testing-guide.md) - Practical guide to writing and running tests

### ðŸ“‹ Processes
- [**Testing Strategy**](testing-strategy.md) - Our comprehensive testing approach
- [**CI/CD Process**](ci-cd.md) - Continuous integration and deployment workflows
- [**Code Standards**](code-standards.md) - Coding conventions and best practices

### ðŸ”§ Technical Decisions

## Overview

ValidAI maintains high quality standards through:

- **Automated Testing**: 80%+ code coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript for consistent, error-free code
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated checks on every commit and deployment
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for all development processes

## Quality Stack

### Testing Framework
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** - Fast unit and integration testing
- **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react)** - Component testing
- **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** - End-to-end testing

### Code Quality
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** - Code linting and error detection
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** - Code formatting
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - Type safety
- **[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)** - Git hooks

### CI/CD
- **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** - Automated workflows
- **[Codecov](https://codecov.io/)** - Coverage reporting
- **Branch Protection** - Enforce quality gates

## Getting Started

### For New Developers

1. **Read the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md)** - Essential setup and commands
2. **Review [Code Standards](code-standards.md)** - Learn our conventions
3. **Practice with [Testing Guide](testing-guide.md)** - Write your first tests
4. **Understand [CI/CD Process](ci-cd.md)** - Learn the development workflow

### For Experienced Team Members

- **[Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md)** - Deep dive into our testing philosophy
- **[Architecture Decisions](architecture-decisions.md)** - Context behind tool choices
- **[CI/CD Process](ci-cd.md)** - Advanced workflow configurations

## Quality Metrics

We track several key metrics to ensure code quality:

### Current Targets
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ overall, 90%+ for critical components
- **Build Success Rate**: 95%+
- **Deployment Frequency**: Daily to staging
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: < 1 hour

### Tools and Dashboards
- **Coverage Reports**: Available in CI/CD pipeline and Codecov
- **Build Metrics**: GitHub Actions dashboard
- **Code Quality**: ESLint reports and SonarCloud (if configured)

## Common Workflows

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start development
npm run dev

# Watch tests while developing
npm run test:watch

# Before committing
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run typecheck
```

### Before Pull Request
```bash
# Run all checks
npm run test:all
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Debugging Issues
```bash
# Debug test failures
npm run test:ui

# Debug E2E issues
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Check formatting
npm run format:check
```

## Team Practices

### Code Reviews
- All changes require code review
- Reviewers check for adherence to standards
- Automated checks must pass before merge

### Testing Philosophy
- Write tests before or alongside feature development
- Aim for meaningful tests, not just coverage numbers
- Mock external dependencies, test our code

### Quality Gates
- **Pre-commit**: Linting, formatting, type checking
- **PR**: Full test suite, build verification
- **Deployment**: Integration tests, security checks

## Contributing to Quality
