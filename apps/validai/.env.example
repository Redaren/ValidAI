# LLM Provider API Keys (Edge Functions)
# These are NOT set in .env files. Instead, configure them as Supabase secrets:
#
# For Anthropic (Claude models):
#   npx supabase secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
#
# For Mistral (Mistral models):
#   npx supabase secrets set MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
#
# Organizations can also configure their own API keys via the UI (Pro/Enterprise feature)
# which will override these global keys for their processors.
#
# Note: At least one provider's global API key must be set for the platform to function.

# Development
# Vercel deployment URL (auto-set by Vercel)
