### 2. Enhanced JSDoc Comments

All source files now have comprehensive JSDoc comments explaining:

#### File-Level Documentation
Each file has a JSDoc block explaining:
- **Purpose** - What the file does
- **Pattern** - What Playze Core pattern it demonstrates
- **Integration** - How it uses shared packages
- **Key Concepts** - Important architectural decisions

#### Component Documentation
Each component includes:
- **Description** - What the component renders
- **Features** - Key functionality
- **Patterns** - Which framework patterns it uses
- **Usage** - How other developers should use it

#### Function Documentation
Each function has:
- **Purpose** - What it does
- **Parameters** - Input descriptions
- **Returns** - Output description
- **Example** - Usage example where applicable
- **Notes** - Important warnings or tips

### 3. Authorization Examples (NEW FEATURE)

TestApp now demonstrates **three authorization patterns** using the unified authorization system:

#### Pattern 1: Tier-Based Feature Gate
```typescript
<AuthGate appId="testapp" feature="professional_demo">
  <ProfessionalFeature />
</AuthGate>
```
- Requires Professional tier subscription
- Free tier users see upgrade prompt
- Checks `tier_features.professional_demo` from database

#### Pattern 2: Role-Based Permission Gate
```typescript
<AuthGate appId="testapp" permission="can_edit">
  <EditButton />
</AuthGate>
```
- Requires edit permission (Owner/Admin/Member roles)
- Viewers see permission denied message
- Checks `role_permissions.can_edit` from database

#### Pattern 3: Combined Authorization
```typescript
<AuthGate
  appId="testapp"
  feature="professional_demo"
  permission="can_export"
  requireAll
>
  <AdvancedExportFeature />
</AuthGate>
```
- Requires BOTH Professional tier AND export permission
- Only Pro + Owner/Admin see this
- Single database query via unified auth system

### 4. Performance Documentation

Documented the unified authorization system's performance benefits:

**Before (Old Pattern):**
- 15 authorization checks = 15 database queries
- Slow page load with multiple feature gates

**After (Unified System):**
- 15 authorization checks = **1 database query**
- Single `useAuthorization()` call fetches everything:
  - User's role
  - Tier features
  - Role permissions
  - Usage limits
  - Current usage
- All hooks share cached result
- 5-minute cache via TanStack Query

## Authorization Documentation Highlights

### Feature: Professional Tier Demo (Lines 239-272)

**What It Shows:**
- Tier-based feature gating
- Uses `AuthGate` with `feature` prop
- Automatic upgrade prompt for Free tier
- In-code documentation of pattern

**Documentation Added:**
```typescript
/**
 * Professional Tier Feature Demo
 *
 * Demonstrates tier-based authorization using AuthGate component.
 *
 * Pattern: Subscription Tier Controls Access
 * - Organization must have Professional tier
 * - Checks tier_features.professional_demo in database
 * - Free tier users see upgrade prompt automatically
 *
 * Implementation:
 * - Uses AuthGate from @playze/shared-ui
 * - Single database query via useAuthorization()
 * - Cached for 5 minutes via TanStack Query
 *
 * Test:
 * - Switch to Free tier organization to see fallback
 */
```

### Feature: Role-Based Permission Demo (Lines 275-310)

**What It Shows:**
- Role-based permission gating
- Uses `AuthGate` with `permission` prop
- Different access by role (Owner/Admin/Member vs Viewer)
- Permission matrix explanation

**Documentation Added:**
```typescript
/**
 * Role-Based Permission Demo
 *
 * Demonstrates role-based authorization using AuthGate component.
 *
 * Pattern: User Role Controls Access
 * - User's role in organization determines permissions
 * - Checks role_permissions.can_edit in database
 * - Independent of subscription tier
 *
 * Role Matrix for TestApp:
 * - Owner/Admin/Member: can_edit = true
 * - Viewer: can_edit = false
 *
 * Implementation:
 * - Uses AuthGate with permission prop
 * - Shares same database query as tier checks
 * - Automatic permission denied message for viewers
 */
```

### Feature: Combined Authorization Demo (Lines 313-349)

**What It Shows:**
- Combined tier + role authorization
- Uses `AuthGate` with BOTH props + `requireAll`
- Most restrictive pattern
- Clear requirements explanation

**Documentation Added:**
```typescript
/**
 * Combined Authorization Demo
 *
 * Demonstrates combined tier + role authorization.
 *
 * Pattern: Requires BOTH Conditions
 * - Organization must have Professional tier (feature)
 * - User must have Owner/Admin role (permission)
 * - Both must be true (requireAll prop)
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Tier: Professional (has professional_demo feature)
 * - Role: Owner/Admin (has can_export permission)
 *
 * Common Use Cases:
 * - Advanced exports (Pro + Admin)
 * - Billing management (any tier + Owner)
 * - Sensitive operations (Enterprise + Owner)
 *
 * Implementation:
 * - Single database query returns both checks
 * - Efficient even with multiple combined gates
 */
```

## Framework Integration Documentation

### Shared Authentication Package

**Documented Hooks:**

```typescript
// Organization Context
useCurrentOrganization()     // Get active organization
useUserOrganizations()        // Get all user's organizations
useOrganizationApps()         // Get org's app subscriptions

// Authorization (Unified System)
useAuthorization()            // PRIMARY: Complete auth context
useFeatureAccess()            // Check tier-based feature
usePermission()               // Check role-based permission
useHasRole()                  // Check user's role

// All authorization hooks share ONE database query
// Result cached for 5 minutes via TanStack Query
```

### Shared UI Package

**Documented Components:**

```typescript
// UI Primitives (shadcn/ui)
Button, Card, Input, Label, Alert

// Platform Components
AppSwitcher                   // Shows app ecosystem
OrgSwitcher                   // Switch organizations
AuthGate                      // Declarative access control

// Icons (re-exported from lucide-react)
LogOut, User, Loader2, Crown, Shield, Edit3, etc.
```

### Performance Optimization

**Documented Strategy:**

```
15 authorization checks on page
    ↓
First hook calls useAuthorization('testapp')
    ↓
ONE database query: get_user_authorization()
    ↓
Returns complete context:
  - user_role
  - tier_features
  - role_permissions
  - tier_limits
  - current_usage
    ↓
Result cached for 5 minutes
    ↓
All 15 checks use cached data
    ↓
Total queries: 1 (not 15!)
```

## Code Comments Enhancement

### Before Enhancement Example:
```typescript
export default function DashboardContent() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null)
  // ... implementation
}
```

### After Enhancement Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Dashboard Content Component
 *
 * This component contains all dashboard functionality and demonstrates:
 * - User authentication state management
 * - Organization context display
 * - Three authorization patterns (tier, role, combined)
 * - Proper use of shared packages
 *
 * Pattern: Regular User Access (PostgREST + RLS)
 * - NOT using admin pattern (SECURITY DEFINER functions)
 * - Data automatically scoped to user's organization
 *
 * Authorization Examples:
 * 1. Tier-based: AuthGate with feature prop
 * 2. Role-based: AuthGate with permission prop
 * 3. Combined: AuthGate with both props + requireAll
 *
 * Performance:
 * - All authorization checks use ONE database query
 * - useAuthorization() caches result for 5 minutes
 * - All hooks share same cached data
 *
 * @component
 * @example
 * // Dynamically imported to prevent hydration
 * const DashboardContent = dynamic(() => import('./dashboard-content'), {
 *   ssr: false
 * })
 */
export default function DashboardContent() {
  // ... implementation with inline comments
}
```
